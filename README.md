# UKFE training material

This training material covers the functionality in the UKFE R package. It is an interactive document where you can run the code yourself and there are some exercises where you have to fill in the gaps. 

Before doing any analysis, you need to install the `UKFE` package. This only needs doing once (it will need redoing if the UKFE package is updated or if you update your version of R).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(UKFE)
```

Once you have installed the package, this will be saved in your package library. Every time you want to use the package, you need to load it from the library using the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(UKFE)
```

This will allow you to use the functions within the package.
